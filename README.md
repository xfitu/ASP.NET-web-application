# ASP.NET-web-application
Claims-aware  ASP.NET web application which uses WS-Federation protocol to communicate with ADFS 3.0 server (Windows Server 2012 R2) for user authentication and ADFS server returns security token (saml 2.0) which contains claims about the authenticated user to be used by this claims-aware application for authorization. The core functionalities of the application are; users can make self-registration or create account in Active Directory via web interface and connect to Active Directory Federation Server (ADFS) so user can authenticate with Active Directory Account. On successful authentication the Application will receive Claims(e.g.username,name,and role) from the ADFS Server and decides which pages can be accessed by each user based user's role in the claims(roles:doctor or patient).This application uses Java Servlet API(https://github.com/xfitu/WebAPI) for creating new user account, add, delete, and update user's attributes in Active Directory(AD DS) and Windows Identity Foundation (WIF library in ASP.NET framework 4.0 in visual studio 2010) to communicate with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server.
